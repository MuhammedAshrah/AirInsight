# AirInsight
AirInsight is a pollution analysis project designed to help users visualize and analyze air quality trends in the region of their choice. By using pollution data from India's major cities, AirInsight provides graphical outputs for various pollutants, enabling users to identify patterns and trends related to air pollution levels. This project uses data from the Air Quality Data in India dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india).

## Features
1. Customizable Analysis: Choose a city, year, and single or multiple pollution parameters (e.g., PM2.5, O3) for in-depth analysis.
2. Graphical Visualization: Easily visualize pollution trends across different months through clear, interactive graphs.

## Usage
1) Run the program
2) Select a city.
3) Select a year.
4) Choose the pollution parameters to graph (e.g., PM10, NO2).
5) View the pollution trend graphs generated based on your selections.
6) You may proceed again for any other city or if you wish to exit, solution of days with high O3 and particle level that can be implemented by the user on a day to day basis will be printed out.
